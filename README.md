The game first stageconsists in identifying lava tubes by using images taken from the NASA database: The player has to tell actual lava tubes from fake ones.  During this first stage, the player has to detect thesurface entrance to alava tube, once there he will start exploring it looking for useful resources and settle near them. The rover we have conceived is the most suitable means toanalyze  Mars surface: having identified lava tube entrances in advance,  it goes straight to a lava tube and checks  if it is accessible or not.   We have devised a rover exploration simulation so that the player   can both have fun while exploring the environments and collect objects. Besides, as soon as he clicks on one of these objects, wiki pages will appear fulfilling thus the game educational purpose.   The game second stage focuses on running an ideal Martian community of ten people living in a lava tube where inflatable modules have been set serving different purposes.  The resources stored have been given a numerical value referring to the amount available. This amount can either increase or decrease daily according to the number of colonists and local premises respectively. In addition, the player can enjoy a basic simulation of the colonistsâ€™ physical as well as mental conditions which have an influence on the greenhouse productionrate.
